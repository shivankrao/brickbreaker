// //game initializes and player clicks start to begin playing




// //player clicks paddle with ball on it to begin playing




// //when the player clicks the paddle the ball is released






//     ////at the beginning of the game, the paddle starts off big
//     ////the ball moves relatively slow
//     ////as the player advances through levels, the paddle becomes smaller, and the ball moves faster
//     ////I want the number of bricks in each level to remain the same (space constraints), but the positions of the bricks to be randomized with each level. 

// //the ball bounces off the bricks and when it hits the brick, the brick disappears





//     ////I want an animation when the brick is destroyed

// //every time the ball hits a brick, the player gains one point





//     //I want it so that in each level, a few bricks will randomly give the user extra points (color coded by amount of points)

// //each player is given 5 lives
// //if the ball does not land on the brick, the player loses a life 

//     //some bricks will randomly grant the user with an extra life
