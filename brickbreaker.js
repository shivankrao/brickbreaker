//start game
//game initializes and player clicks start to begin playing
//player clicks paddle with ball on it to begin playing
//when the player clicks the paddle the ball is released

    ////at the beginning of the game, the paddle starts off big
    ////the ball moves relatively slow
    ////as the player advances through levels, the paddle becomes smaller, and the ball moves faster
    ////I want the number of bricks in each level to remain the same (space constraints), but the positions of the bricks to be randomized with each level. 

//the ball bounces off the bricks and when it hits the brick, the brick disappears

    ////I want an animation when the brick is destroyed

//every time the ball hits a brick, the player gains one point

    //I want it so that in each level, a few bricks will randomly give the user extra points (color coded by amount of points)

//each player is given 5 lives
//if the ball does not land on the brick, the player loses a life 

    //some bricks will randomly grant the user with an extra life
